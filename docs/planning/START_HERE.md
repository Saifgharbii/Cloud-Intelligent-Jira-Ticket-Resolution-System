## 👋 Who Is This For?

**Perfect for you if:**
- ✅ You have experience with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- ✅ You're comfortable with Gen AI, LLMs, and embeddings
- ✅ You know Python programming well
- ✅ This is your **FIRST TIME** with AWS, CI/CD, or MLOps
- ✅ You want to build a production-grade cloud system
- ✅ You can dedicate 15 days × 6 hours/day (90 hours total)

**Not quite ready?**
- If you're completely new to programming → Learn Python first
